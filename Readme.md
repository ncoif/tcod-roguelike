# tcod-roguelike

My own take at following the tcod [tutorial](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/), in rust.

Inspired from the following:
- [Josh Ge - How to Make a Roguelike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jviNpRGuCIU)
- [Build a Roguelike in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0-xjeEiYw4)
